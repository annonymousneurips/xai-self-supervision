PyTorch code for **Visualizing and Understanding Self-Supervised Vision Learning**

To experiment with this code, simply open the jupyter notebook `xai.ipynb`.

Either download [ImageNet](https://image-net.org/download.php) validation set (in that case you will have the images in `val/images/`) or use an image of your interest. In that case, please change the path in jupyter file to point to your image of interest. 

For SimCLRv2 models, please download from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mw5o_6kzYNnI-IJAUgNYDGFNV8ig3Rer?usp=sharing) and place them in `pretrained_models/simclr2_models/`
